\\we create a structure that defines the contact based on Name, address, father name, mother name, mobile number, sex, email id, Aadhar number using different data types such as char/long/int.
-Create the required functions: -
-We create the menu
-Start/back/add record/list record/modify record/delete record these functions can have a function of void or int as necessary.
-We create record function
-We create add record.
-We ask the user to ask the user to add their personal address and hence save the record.
-List record here we organize different contact in a structural manner in a memory block called file which is dynamically allocated with the help of pointers.
-Search record here we traverse through the information provided by using pointers
-Modify record
Helps to edit the details of the contact if needed
